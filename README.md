# what-i-can-do-with-python
This repository is a growing collection of Python projects I build as ideas pop into my head. Sometimes the goal is to solve a practical problem, sometimes it’s just to understand how something works under the hood.  Each project is written from scratch, with a focus on clear thinking, simple logic, and solid Python fundamentals. I share the code openly, explain the approach, and occasionally package the solution into a small interactive app.  This repo is part of my “What I Can Do With Python” series, where I document progress, not perfection, one idea, one function, one project at a time.
